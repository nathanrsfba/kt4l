This reads a set of configuration files provided on the command line, which
should be a series of lines in KEY=VALUE pairs, and lines starting with #
symbols are comments. It then reads stdin, replaces any instances of %KEY% with the corresponding VALUE.

This serves two purposes. Firstly, the configuration files can be stored in
version control, separate from the password. The "actual" configuration files
will be generated by launch scripts, using this tool. Secondly, values common
to more than one configuration file can be stored once.
