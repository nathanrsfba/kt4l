# Tools #

Tools found in this directory:

## cfgtemplate ##

This reads a set of configuration files provided on the command line, which
should be a series of lines in KEY=VALUE pairs, and lines starting with #
symbols are comments. It then reads stdin, replaces any instances of %KEY% with
the corresponding VALUE.

This serves two purposes. Firstly, the configuration files can be stored in
version control, separate from the password. The "actual" configuration files
will be generated by launch scripts, using this tool. Secondly, values common
to more than one configuration file can be stored once.

## launch ##

This will launch the radio server, performing a few tasks beforehand to set
everything up. This includes generating the actual configuration files in /tmp
from the templates in config/, making sure the log directory exists, and making
sure the password file is not world readable.

## mp3index ##

This creates an HTML index of the files in the library. It takes two command
line parameters: A template file, which is used to generate the HTML, and the
directory to index for MP3 files. The output will be printed to stdout.

The template file should be an HTML file containing the desired HTML content.
There should be a single line containing placeholders in the form of %link% (an
href linking to the file), %title% (track title), and %artist% (track artist).
The script will repeat this line once for each file, replacing the placeholders
as appropriate.

The directory should contain the root of the library directory. All links will
be relative to what appears here; in the case of Deliria, this should be run
from the library directory, and the directory should just be '.'.

## reindex ##

A short shell script that runs mp3index to regen the library index
