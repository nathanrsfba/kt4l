"""Decode an MP3 file with effects applied.

This will decode the file given on the command line to a raw PCM file, applying
effects to it, using Madplay and Sox.

The file is examined for certain ID3 tags that tell it what effects to apply.
These are TXXX flags with the folling descriptions:

Start: The time point in the track to begin rendering. Or, alternately stated,
    the amount of time at the start of the file to skip. This can be given as
    (fractional) seconds, or in MM:SS format.
End: The time point to stop rendering. This can be either be either an absolute
    time (again, as seconds, or MM:SS), or can be a negative number of seconds,
    in which that many seconds are removed from the end.
FadeIn: Number of seconds to fade in a the start
FadeOut: Number of seconds to fade out at the end

The 'settings' class determines the format to decode to, and any additional Sox
effects to apply to the output.
